# Red-Assessment

The website is a landing page for Red Academy using HTML & CSS.

The project incorporates flexbox to space items.

An interesting problem occured when using an \<hr> element in combination with flexbox which causes it to 
become a vertical section divide. A simple solution to this is to set the \<hr> width to 100% in the CSS.

Added a tab icon by converting the .jpg to .ico with an online tool. This imporves backward compatibility.
